/*
A variable with a unique name is called an identifier in C++.
It is best to use descriptive and meaningful names for the variables
to make the code self-explanatory.

It is goog practice NOT to start an identifier with n underscore.  Also,
avoid using a number as the first character of an identifier.
- Avoid these characters all together in an identifier - &, @, *, !, etc.
- Do not use C++ keywords (char, case, const bool, while, if etc)
