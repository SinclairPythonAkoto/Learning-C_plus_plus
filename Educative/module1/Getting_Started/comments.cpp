    cout << "Hello world" << endl;
    cout << "This section is about writing comments and white spaces.";
}

/*
This is a multiline comment.
you will be able to write multiple lines
which the compiler wil ignore.

You can also use blank lines, spaces, tabs etc

It is good to add spaces in a program to increase readability.
