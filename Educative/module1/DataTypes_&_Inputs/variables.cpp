/*

Declare a variable:
variable_datatype variable_name

- first you have to declare the data type, then the variable name.
- You can declare more than one variable on a single line:
  - int number1, number2, number3
- you can give the variable a value (initilaise the variable) all in the same line or in th enext line if you choose

eg.
variable_datatype variable_name = value;
variable_name = value;

- C++ is a statically-typed languange so the variables have to be declared before they are used.
