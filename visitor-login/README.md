# Visitor Login System 1 #

This will be my first attempt to create a basic visitor login system using C++ with the skills that I have currently learned.

The login system will be very basic and will be executed on the terminal - so no fancy GUI at this point I'm afriad :sweat_smile:

This program is designed around a fictional company which has a HR team that can create new employees and update it on their company system; the HR can also remove old employees.
Staff can log in with their username & password, then can choose to book a meeting with any staff member from the compnay or with an external client.
The rececptionist can also log onto the system to view bookings and make a note on the system for when the guests arrive.


### Project Objectives ###
- Create a menu for the HR to login 
- HR can login with a password to create a new employee or remove an old employee
- Create functionality for staff to be able to chnage their password & book a meeting once they login 
- Create functionality where receptionists can view all bookings within the compnay, also create a note for arrived guests.
- Store all compnay employees in one file
- Store all meetings with staff and guests in one file
