# If Statements in C++ #

With *if statements*, we can write more complex code making our programs smarter in the way they react to certain data or user input.  This will be a very useful tool as we can control our programs to execute code ***if*** a condition it met, or ***else*** a different condition is met.

There are 3x main key words when using if statements:
- `if` - *check against the* **first** *condition*.
- `if else` - *check against* **multiple** *conditions after the first condition has not been met*.
- `else` - *check against the* **last** *condition*.

- `&&` - and operator *(both conditions need to be true)*
- `||` - or operator *(only one condition needs to be true)*
- `!` - negation operator *(place this before the condition to negate it)*
