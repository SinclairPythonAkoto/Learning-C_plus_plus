# Creating Variables #

Variables are essentially containers which allow a program to store different pieces of information inside of them. Once the information is stored inside the variable, that information can then be accessed throughout the program simply by referring to the variable's name.


#### Rules for variables ####
- We need to tell C++ what **type** of variable we are creating *(boolean, integer, string etc)*
- Names are case-sensitive so they should begin with:
  - **letters** or **underscore_**
- After, teh characters can be:
  - **letters**, **numbers** or **underscore_**
- Convention says you can start with a lowercase word, then words after that will need to have the first letter capitalised.
  - eg. **myFirstVariable**

*It is better to have a variable name that is long and descriptive rather than one that is short or confusing!*
