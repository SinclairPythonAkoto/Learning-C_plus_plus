# For Loops in C++ #

For loops are a little similar to while loops; it checks for a *boolean expression* on each iteration of the loop and executes the code if it's *true*.

To create a for loop we just follow the 3x simple steps:
1. Create the variable.
2. Specify the looping condition.
3. Specify the line of cod ethat will be executed after every iteration of the loop.

*Lets look at an example below*

```
for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++){
    cout << i << endl;
}
```
I have broken down the for loop so you can understand what is going on.

```
for every.. (declaring/specifying a counting variable ; boolean expression ; action for every iteration)
```
