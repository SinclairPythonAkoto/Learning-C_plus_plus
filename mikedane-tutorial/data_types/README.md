# Data Types #

Almost all data can be broken down into *three* categories:

- Text *(string or char)*
- Numbers *(integers or floats)*
- True/False values *(booleans)*

With these three fundamental types of data, we can keep track of almost anything!

*These three distinct types of information are each handled a bit differently in C++.  There will be certain things we can do with numbers that we can't do with strings or text (like division, multiplication etc).  There will be also a whole range of things we can do with bollean values that we cannot do with strings or numbers*

***You always want to be aware of what data types you're using when writing a program that's keeping track of different pieces of information.***
