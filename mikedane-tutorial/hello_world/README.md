# Hello World! #

Here is a simple C++ program that prints `Hello world!` onto the terminal.

```
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;
```
This is esentially the configuration options for the C++ file.  This needs to be included to be able to run our program.

***More about this will be mentioned later***

We have created a function `int main()` which will be used to contain the C++ code in which we want to execute.

- `cout` - console output
- `endl` - end line
