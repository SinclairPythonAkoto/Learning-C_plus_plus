# Drawing A Pyramid #

With this file C++ is going through the `main()` function and printing out each line which will create a triangle.  

The program will print the set of instructions we give to the computer line by line, starting from the top then making its way down to the bottom.

As we progress we will be giving the computer more complex instructions and combine them in different ways to be abe to execute more complex commands.
