# Creating a Mad Libs game! #

#### What is Mad Libs? ####
**Mad Libs** is a simple game where the user is prompted for a bunch of words which are used to fill in the blanks of a story.

What we will do is create a simople game where we will prompt the user for words in which we will store inside a a variable then add that to our story.  To keep it short and basic, we will use a simple poem.

*This is a good exercise to get user inputs and handling the data.*

**Will create a second mad libs game later!**
