For this project we will learn how to use **CRUD** operations *(create, read, update, delete)* in C++.

This app will allow you to create a record in the terminal, then gives the user an option to update an existing record, delete an exisiting record or show all records that have been created.
You also have the option to save all the records created into a text file.

By learning how to create apps using the basic principles of CRUD operations, you can then use the knowledge to build much more complex apps and software!
